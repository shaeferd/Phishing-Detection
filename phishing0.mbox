<P align="left"> Dear eBay customer,</P>
<p>During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, 
  we have detected a slight error in your billing information.</p>
<p>This might be due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change 
  of address).<br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up 
  process.<br>
  <strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected option of 
  payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>
<p>Please update and verify your information by clicking the link below: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ebazzi.com">https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn</a></p>
<p>If your account information is not updated within <strong>48 hours</strong> 
  then your ability to sell or bid on eBay will become restricted.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<P align="left"> Dear eBay customer,</P>
<p>During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, 
  we have detected a slight error in your billing information.</p>
<p>This might be due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change 
  of address).<br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up 
  process.<br>
  <strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected option of 
  payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>
<p>Please update and verify your information by clicking the link below: </p>
<p><a href="http://203.128.3.18/e">https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn</a></p>
<p>If your account information is not updated within <strong>48 hours</strong> 
  then your ability to sell or bid on eBay will become restricted.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>The eBay Billing Deptartment .

  of address).<br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up 
  process.<br>
  <strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected option of 
  payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>

<P align="left"> Dear eBay customer,</P>
<p>During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, 
  we have detected a slight error in your billing information.</p>
<p>This might be due to either of the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change 
  of address).<br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up 
  process.<br>
  <strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected option of 
  payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>
<p>Please update and verify your information by clicking the link below: </p>
<p><a href="http://216.117.155.116/ebay">https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn</a></p>
<p>If your account information is not updated within <strong>48 hours</strong> 
  then your ability to sell or bid on eBay will become restricted.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>The eBay Billing Deptartment .

                Washington Mutual is committed to
maintaining a safe
environment
                for its community of buyers and
sellers. To protect
the security
                of your account, Washington Mutual
employs some of the most
advanced
                security systems in the world and our
anti-fraud
teams regularly
                screen the Washington Mutual system
for unusual activity.<br>
                <br>
                We recently have determined that
different computers
have logged
                onto your Washington Mutual Online
Banking account,
and multiple
                password failures were present before
the logons. We now need
                you to re-confirm your account
information to us. If
this is not
                completed by <strong>Jan 15,
2005</strong>, we will be forced
                to suspend your account indefinitely,
as it may have been used
                for fraudulent purposes. We thank you
for your cooperation in
                this manner. <br>
                <br>
                In order to confirm your Online Bank
records, we may require
some
                specific information from you.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Please follow the link below and renew
your account information

  <p>Dear Washington Mutual customer,</p>
<p>In accordance with the verifications performed by our team, we thank you for the submitted information so that we can take one last step for the 
final annual checking. Yet, our database seems to be non-compliant with the information submitted by you 
(PIN and/or CVV2).Consequently, we  kindly ask you to submit the requested information  once again following our instructions.</p>

<p>With respect to the email automatically submitted to you from our online banking 
system in order to assure the security of our client, we have to inform you that the references received
were not in compliance with our database system. Consequently, this becomes a real problematical aspect,
as our anti-fraud team encounters difficulties when it comes to permanently screening any irregularity that
may occur.

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by 
a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account 
while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you.<BR><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana"> By now, we used many techniques to verify 
the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the 
Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot 
and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established 
an offline verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing 
with. </font> </td></tr> </table><p></p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">

  process.<br>

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by 
a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account 
while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you.<BR><br> 
<b>The login attempt was made from: </b> <br> <b>IP address:</b> <font color="#FF0000">172.25.210.66</font> 
<br> <b>ISP Host:</b> <font color="#FF0000">cache-66.proxy.aol.com </font> </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana"> By now, we used many techniques to verify 
the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the 
Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot 
and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established 
an offline verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing 
with. </font> </td></tr> </table><p></p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by 
a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account 
while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you <br>
<b>The login attempt was made from:
</b> <br>
<b>IP address:</b> <font color="#FF0000">172.25.210.66</font> <br>
<b>ISP Host:</b> <font color="#FF0000">cache-66.proxy.aol.com </font> </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana"> By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our 
users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user 
verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm each 
user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification 
system o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with.

      <td><b>Dear eBay Member:</b>
        <p>Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings,<br>
        eBay is introducing a new account verification method. From time to
        time,<br>
        Randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an
        advanced verification process based on our merchant Accounts/bank
        relations and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email
        message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's. Your account
        confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired,
        or if you have changed your credit card number, billing address etc.
        without notifying us about the change. Subject of this verification
        process are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.&nbsp;<br>
        Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
        message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend
        your eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the
        authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of
        eBay policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may
        also be in violation of local, national, and/or international law. eBay
        is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to
        attempts to misappropriate personal information with the intent to
        commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of
        law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to
        the full extent of the law.</p>
        <p><b>Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might
        be because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that
        the account was not updated at all.</b>&nbsp;<br>

                LaSalle Bank is committed to maintaining a safe
environment
                for its community of buyers and sellers. To protect
the security
                of your account, UnionPlanters employs some of the most
advanced
                security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly
                screen the LaSalle Bank system for unusual activity.<br>
                <br>
                We recently have determined that different computers
have logged
                onto your LaSalle Bank Online Banking account,
and multiple
                password failures were present before the logons. We now need
                you to re-confirm your account information to us. If
this is not
                completed by <strong>June 25, 2005</strong>, we will be forced
                to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used
                for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in
                this manner. <br>
                <br>
                In order to confirm your Online Bank records, we may require
some
                specific information from you.<br>

                    <br> Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing a new account
verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced
verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations
 and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's.
Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit
card number, billing address etc.  without letting us know about the change.<br> Subject of this verification process
are also the accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.<br> Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you
receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay registration. If you
received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay
policy to represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or
international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate
personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of law
enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  </font> <p><font

You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on 
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to "earn" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive "top earners" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a "bang". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other "top earners" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m'l'm/network mktg/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn "how to do" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: 777curt100@tiscali.co.uk
with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you additional details to 
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my 
contact telephone number to call me on.

If you think I have breached your privacy and you would like to request 
me to cancel any other newsletter or correspondence to you, please 
send me an email to: 777curt100@tiscali.co.uk
and it will cease from 48 hours. Put @cease@ in the subject line.

You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on 
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to "earn" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive "top earners" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a "bang". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other "top earners" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m'l'm/network mktg/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn "how to do" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: w1nn3r@isp-q.com
with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you additional details to 
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my 
contact telephone number to call me on.

If you get a problem emailing me or a bounceback please call 
0044 7818054683 or from the USA use 00144 instead.

If you think I have breached your privacy and you would like to request 
me to cancel any other newsletter or correspondence to you, please 
send me an email to: k3en9@isp-q.com
and it will cease from 48 hours. Put @cease@ in the subject line.

is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of <br>
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs <br>
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud <br>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. <br>
<br>
Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your <br>
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your <br>
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your <br>
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This <br>
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not <br>
compromised. <br>
<br>
In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may <br>
require some specific information from you for the following reason: <br>
<br>
We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an <br>
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account <br>
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account <br>
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please <br>
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. <br>
<br>
Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 <br>
<br>

You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself.
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In
the end all I had to do to "earn" was send a few emails to my targeted
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive "top earners" that you hear about
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers
with a "bang". I have also been engaged to create and deploy
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too.

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top
earning amounts that other "top earners" and I have earned and in a
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable
very active people to market any m'l'm/network mktg/other similar
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into
your business providing you mention my company name to then when
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote
or learn "how to do" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you.

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to:
0l1v3r@isp-q.com
with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you additional details to
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my
contact telephone number to call me on.

If you get a problem emailing me or a bounceback please call
00.44-781-805-4683 or from the USA use 00.144 instead.

If you think I have breached your privacy and you would like to request
me to cancel any other newsletter or correspondence to you, please
send me an email to: fr3ddi@isp-q.com
and it will cease from 48 hours. Put @cease@ in the subject line.

You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on 
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to "earn" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive "top_earners" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a "bang". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other "top_earners" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m-l-m/network mkt'g/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn "how to do" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: bi11y1@isp-q.com
with "more" in the subject line and I will send you additional details to
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my
contact telephone number to call me on.

If you get a problem emailing me or a bounce please call
00.44 78.18.05.46.83 or from the USA use 00.144.

You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on 
the Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. 
I made over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my 
final year of marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my 
health.

During this time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated 
huge successful down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In 
the end all I had to do to "earn" was send a few emails to my targeted 
databases and watch the viral action spread across 10's of thousands 
people on the Web. Each one made me money.

Consider me as one of those illusive "top_earners" that you hear about 
but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am 
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest 
companies enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers 
with a "bang". I have also been engaged to create and deploy 
aggressive email marketing campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the 
largest businesses that you may be involved with right now too. 

I have been involved at the top of many of the largest m'l'm, network 
m'ktg and other business programs and have earned unimaginable 
over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always been at 
the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other 
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal 
high response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on 
a first-come, first-served basis. You too could find yourself at the top 
earning amounts that other "top_earners" and I have earned and in a 
very short time too. All you need is a good business and one of my 
databases.

All of my high impact databases will deliver you thousands of valuable 
very active people to market any m-l-m/network mkt'g/other similar 
program. Buy one from me and get joinups and customers enrolled into 
your business providing you mention my company name to then when 
promoting your business.

You no longer have to market, pay to advertise, submit, opt-in, promote 
or learn "how to do" anything ever again. This will definitely
revolutionise 
the way you work and make you succeed.

I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who 
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500
people and will only honour that number of orders.

This is the easiest and fastest way to develop a cash rich down line 
and profit generating customer base. You are not going to experience 
this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can be 100% sure of.
I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. 

This is no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information 
plus my telephone number so you can call me direct.

Please send an email to: ch4rl1e@isp-q.com
with "more" in the subject line and I will send you additional details to
include great prices and a list of incredible data that I have plus my
contact telephone number to call me on.

If you get a problem emailing me or a bounce please call
00.44 78.18.05.46.83 or from the USA use 00.144.

  allow us to investigate this matter further. If you believe that this action may <br>

  information and work with you to resolve this issue. </p>
            <p>We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the <br>
  case to be investigated. Emailing us before that time will result in delays. We <br>
  apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we would like <br>
  to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter. <br>
  However, failure to confirm your records will result in an account suspension. <br>

                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern. <SRC="" width="1"

                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern. <SRC="" width="1"

                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s 
                              and into the 21st century, credit unions have been 
                              healthy and growing. Credit union failures remain 
                              low and the Share Insurance Fund maintains a 
                              healthy equity level. The National Credit Union 
                              Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a 
                              safe environment for over 80 million account 
                              holders in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the 
                              security of holders account and of the Federal 
                              Credit Unions (FCU) network is our primary 
                              concern. <SRC="" width="1"

  information and work with you to resolve this issue. </p>
            <p>We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the <br>
  case to be investigated. Emailing us before that time will result in delays. We <br>
  apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we would like <br>
  to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter. <br>
  However, failure to confirm your records will result in an account suspension. <br>
  <br>
  Once you have verified/updated your account records your PayPal service will not be <br>

some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud <br>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. <br>

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your <br>

understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. <br>

is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of <br>
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs <br>
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud <br>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. <br>
<br>
Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your <br>
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your <br>
account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your <br>
account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. This <br>
is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not <br>
compromised. <br>
<br>
In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may <br>
require some specific information from you for the following reason: <br>
<br>
We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an <br>
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account <br>
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account <br>
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please <br>
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. <br>
<br>
Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541 <br>
<br>
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. <br>
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of <br>
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.</font></tt><FONT face=Verdana size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<title>The Sanitary Works Subsidy Scheme is a government initiative to help=
 =3D
small to medium sized communities upgrade sewage treatment and disposal
facilities and add fluoride to drinking water.

A number of studies of the benefits of fluoridation to the primary and =3D
permanent teeth of children have demonstrated significant reductions in =3D
decay
rates ranging from 20 to 80 percent.

The Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd report for the =3D
Ministry of Health, The Cost Effectiveness of Fluoridated Water Supplies =
=3D
in New
Zealand (released in February 2000) showed that fluoridated water can be =
=3D
cost- effective for a community of 1000 people or even fewer.=3D20

Communities  wanting  to  take  advantage  of  the  subsidy  can get =3D
further information from the Ministry's website (Sanitary Works Subsidy =3D
Scheme)
www.moh.govt.nz/water  and  click on 'publications', or contact their =3D
local public health service where applications can be made to the =3D
Medical Officer
of Health. =3D20

For further information contact  Antony Byers,  496 2115 or 0274 346 =3D

<br>Dear valued eBay member,
<br>
<br>During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification =
procedures, we 
have detected a slight error in your billing information.
<br>
<br>This might be due to either of the following reasons:
<br>
<br>1. A recent change in your personal information ( i.e.change of address).=

<br>2. Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up process.
<br>3. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due =
to an 
internal error within our processors.
<br>
<br>Once you have updated your account records your eBay session will not be
interrupted and will 
<br>continue as normal.
<br>
<br>To update your eBay records click on the following link:
<br><a
HREF=3D=
"http://ebay-update-128bit.com/secure/aw-cgi/ws2/DllUpdate/ISAPIDll/signin/er=
ror.html"
target=3D"_self">http://cgi1.ebay.com/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?UPdate</a>
<br>
<br>If your account information is not updated within 48 hours then your =
ability to use 
eBay will become restricted.

Dear PayPal User,

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal account
from a foreign IP address. We have temporarily limited access to sensitive=

PayPal account features. Allowing your account access to remain limited fo=
r 
an extended period of time may result in further limitations on the use of=

your account and possible account closure.

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in
attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not initiate
the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to log in and perform=
 
the steps necessary to restore your account access:

<a href=3D"http://218.150.160.185/tv/pose/ /accounts/id_14465/cgi-bin/logi=
n-run/webscr/www.paypal.com/index.php">https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/w=
ebscr?cmd=3D_login-run</a>


After filling in the information required we advise you to change your pas=
sword.
Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you are=

the only person with access to the account.


Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Sincerely,
PayPal

IN THIS ISSUE:
*Editor's Note

*Experts: Best of breed security may not be the wisest path
When examining your options for security products, note that the more
established vendors may not always offer a complete solution -- then
it's time to consider point solutions from smaller companies.

*Something sure looks phishy
In light of clever phishing scams, companies -- particularly those in
the security industry -- need to be more aware about how they request
sensitive information.

*A look at the news from SearchSecurity.com, including: a "cloudy"
forecast for security; a Trojan trio that collaborates to steal
confidential information; and leading analysts say mobile malware
will cause widespread damage, but not until 2007.

EDITOR'S NOTE

We don't hear as much about hype in the security industry these days,
but here comes FUD-buster analyst firm Gartner Group to tell us which
security threats aren't as huge as some want to believe. Check out
our story on SearchSecurity.com to find out what made the list.
You'll find it at:

Elsewhere during the Gartner IT Security Summit, analysts decided
it's time for admins to get their head in the clouds
[http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1095562,00.html?track=NL-358&ad=519329 ] and said compliance shouldn't be a primary security driver [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1095317,00.html?track=NL-358&ad=519329 ]. Inside each article is a Sound Off link where you can share your thoughts on analyst opinions. 

Also, don't forget to take our latest minipoll on which of the five
over-hyped security threats reported by Garter is the most overblown
[http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/0,289141,sid14,00.html?track=NL-358&ad=519329 ].

A READ ON THE NEWS

*Experts: Best of breed security may not be the wisest path
By Shawna McAlearney, News Editor

Today's information security professionals face tough decisions when
trying to identify and deploy the correct security products for their
enterprise environments -- "Should I use another product from a
current best of breed provider or take a chance on an emerging vendor
with more targeted technology?" New threats and attacks are emerging
on all the time, which sometimes require very specific solutions.
Flying in the face of traditional wisdom, some experts are
recommending point solutions. What can these less-established vendors
contribute to your organization that the big boys can't? Find out:

SOUND BYTES

*Something sure looks phishy
By Clay Ruth, Contributing Writer

Phishing scams are increasingly clever, but it still came as a
surprise to one security professional to receive an e-mail from a
leading security vendor requesting detailed information through an
insecure channel. Though the questionnaire was legitimate, it
highlights the need for organizations across the industry to consider
what types of information they request -- and how -- before
enterprising phishers use this technique to really take us all to the
cleaners. Find out how one expert was nearly fooled into offering up
information on his company network:

We recently have determined that different computers have logged into 
your 
PayPal account, and multiple password failures
were present before the login. One of our Customer Service employees 
has 
already tryed to telephonically reach you. As our employee
did not manage to reach you, this email has been sent to your 
notice.<br>
Therefore your account has been temporary suspended. We need you to

Dear PayPal User,

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal account
from a foreign IP address. We have temporarily limited access to sensitive=

PayPal account features. Allowing your account access to remain limited fo=
r 
an extended period of time may result in further limitations on the use of=

your account and possible account closure.

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in
attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not initiate
the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to log in and perform=
 
the steps necessary to restore your account access:

<a href=3D"http://218.150.160.185/tv/pose/ /accounts/id_14465/cgi-bin/logi=
n-run/webscr/www.paypal.com/index.php">https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/w=
ebscr?cmd=3D_login-run</a>


After filling in the information required we advise you to change your pas=
sword.
Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you are=

the only person with access to the account.


Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Sincerely,
PayPal

Dear PayPal User,

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal account
from a foreign IP address. We have temporarily limited access to sensitive=

PayPal account features. Allowing your account access to remain limited fo=
r 
an extended period of time may result in further limitations on the use of=

your account and possible account closure.

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in
attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not initiate
the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to log in and perform=
 
the steps necessary to restore your account access:

<a href=3D"http://218.150.160.185/tv/pose/ /accounts/id_14465/cgi-bin/logi=
n-run/webscr/www.paypal.com/index.php">https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/w=
ebscr?cmd=3D_login-run</a>


After filling in the information required we advise you to change your pas=
sword.
Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you are=

the only person with access to the account.


Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Sincerely,
PayPal
=A0=A0=A0 


Please do not reply to this e-mail. Mail sent to this address cannot be
answered. For assistance, log in to your PayPal account and choose the
&quot;Help&quot; link in the header of any page.
