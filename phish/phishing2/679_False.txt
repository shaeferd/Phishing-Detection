Subject: WARNING: CONFIRM YOUR ONLINE BANKING RECORDS We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto your Online Banking account, and multiple password failures were present before the logons
 We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us
 If this is not completed by March 26, 2006, we will be forced to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes
