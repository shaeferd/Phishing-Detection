Subject: Important Changes 
 Dear BB&T; Customer, We're pleased to announce that later this month your online account information will be available through BB&T; OnlineSM
 The site was recently ranked #1 by Gómez, an independent Internet rating service
 It is easy to navigate, with icons to guide you to many of our most frequently used services
 See for yourself by taking a test-drive: To make the switch you will need to re-enroll your account by clicking the above link as soon as possible, as your business card accounts will no longer be available in our old database
 Please note the following changes to the payment posting policy on BB&T; OnlineSM: Payments made prior to 4PM EST will be credited the same day
 Payments made after 4PM EST will be credited the next day at no charge
 If it is after 4PM and you need your payment to be credited the same day, you can do so for a fee
