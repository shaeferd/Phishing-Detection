Subject: Security Measures
 Dear Customers, The Royal Bank of Scotland always look forward for the high security of our clients
 Some customers have been receiving an email claiming to be from The Royal Bank of Scotland advising them to follow a link to what appear to be a The Royal Bank of Scotland web site, where they are prompted to enter their personal Online Banking details
 The Royal Bank of Scotland Digital Banking is in no way involved with this email and the web site does not belong to us
 The Royal Bank of Scotland is proud to announce about our new updated secure system
 We updated our new SSL servers to give our customers a better, fast and secure online banking service
 Due to the recent update of the servers, you are requested to please update your account info at the following link
