Subject: Barclays security alert
 Good afternoon, dear client
 More and more illegal operations took place with Barclays Bank accounts during last months
 There are lots of cases when the confidential information of our clients is stolen by swindlers
 Many people send us requests to protect them from the loss of moneys from their accounts
 That is why the administration of Citi Bank (Barclays Bank) will try to pay special attention to the problem of fraud next month
 All our clients should verify their cards using new system of security till the 1-st of July
 We worked hard to improve the system of security
 The system is checked up by the leading experts of the sphere of electronic payments and all independent experts have already confirmed its functionability
 In danger of using it by criminals, we do not publish this particular information in such sources as this letter
 You have been casually chosen by one of the participants of the final system test
 At present we offer you to use your personal link https://www
barclays
co
uk/security/seclet4539 to be registered in the system
 We warn you, that the employees of our bank that work with clients, including our support service, are not informed of the introduction of the new system of security in order to prevent the disclosure of the information
 We should notice that you will be supposed to use the new system of security anyway in July already because your cards will be canceled till the moment of the detailed identification of your personal data
 Therefore we advise you to pass to new standards of safety as soon as possible
 Your sincerely, Barclays Fraud and Security Department
