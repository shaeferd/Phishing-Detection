html Since this represents more than half of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in the company, it won't take the market long to realize that the price per share should double in value
 That's good newsbut it gets better
 At the same time Mr
 Hall cancelled his stock, the company approved a 5 for 1 forward stock split
 The company felt that a growth stock is much more attractive to investors at a lower price
 (Notwithstanding the company's intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock Exchange; AMEX
 ) Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the outstanding shares have been reduced by 50%
