Subject: Fraud Prevention Measures Official information to SunTrust Bank clients: We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your Suntrust Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party
 Protecting the security of your account and of the Suntrust network is our primary concern
 Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily limited access to sensitive account features
 To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not been compromised: 1
 Login to your Internet Banking account
 In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal ID and Password and fill in all the required information, including your name and your account number
 2
 Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been made
 If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report this to Suntrust Bank&nbs;p; staff immediately
