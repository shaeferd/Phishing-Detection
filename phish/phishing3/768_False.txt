 To be fair, a script to flush your rules would be nice sure

 On my personal network, I don't care if they re-connect or blow up

I try and implement aggressive filters
(bogon/flood-blocking/nbar/URPF/anti-spoof, etc
) for my customer
networks
 Yes it works for the most part but we occasionally run into
buffer/congestion issues and this is where qos comes to our rescue


We monitor (proactive approach) our qos policies very closely because
they can possibly work against us given certain (white-list)
application-level data rate that are in use
