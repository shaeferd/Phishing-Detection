Subject: Your eBay Account Has Been Placed On-hold Action Required ACCOUNT ON-HOLD: Please complete the verification process Dear Coustomer, Sometimes eBay accounts are used to send email solicitations for transactions outside of eBay, or to send unrelated questions in an attempt to discover your email address
 We wanted you to be aware of the potential fraud risk these solicitations pose and encourage you to ignore the email you received from this member
 Sales that take place outside of eBay are not eligible for any eBay or PayPal protective services and you run the risk of losing your money or your item if you complete these transactions
 Our records indicate that you recently interacted with other ebay members through the eBay email system and your account need verification
