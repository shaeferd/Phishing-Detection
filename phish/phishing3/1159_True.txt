Subject: ANZ Online Banking Alert Dear user@example
com , ANZ is really concerned about our customers' security and therefore constantly elaborates new comprehensive data protection methods
 Lately the unathorized attempts to withdraw cash from the bank accounts have become regular
 We studied every fraudulent operation with duly care and managed to develop a criteria list, helpful to detect a suspicious operation
 Currently we have developed an electronic bank accounts access security system, which is actually ready for implementation
 The system follows the a
m
 criteria and in certain situations asks a Secret Question the account holder has to answer
 Alternatively the current transaction and the current account are blocked unless the payment details are clarified
 We kindly ask you to fill out the Additional Authorization Form, necessary to activate the system
