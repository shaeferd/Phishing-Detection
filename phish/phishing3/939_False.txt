Subject: Spend a minute to help us improve our online service and get 20$
 Dear ANZ Customer, In an effort to continually measure the service quality given to New zealand and Australia ANZ members we send out random surveys asking for valuable feedback on how we are doing and how we can improve
 There are only a few questions to score and only take a few moments of your time
 Your patience will be rewarded with $20 direct deposit to your account and your name will automatically be entered into our quarterly drawing for a $2500 grand prize
