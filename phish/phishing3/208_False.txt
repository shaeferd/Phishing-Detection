Subject: Important Account Update New Page 1 > Dear customers: Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking users
 To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically review accounts
 Your account might be place on restricted status
 Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds
 To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification process
 You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well
 All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information on file
 To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary fields: > https://online
