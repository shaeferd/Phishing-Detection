buyers and sellers
 To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud

We are contacting you to remind you that on November 2, 2006 our Account
Review Team identified some unusual activity in your account

with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been
compromised, access to your account was limited

remain limited until this issue has been resolved

unauthorized third party
 Because protecting the security of your account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account
features
 We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection
<br><br>

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some additional information from you
