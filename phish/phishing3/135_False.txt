 PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of buyers and sellers
 To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity
 We recently noted one or more attempts to log in to your account from a foreign country
 If you accessed your account while traveling, the attempt(s) may have been initiated by you
 Because the behavior was unusual for your account, we would like to take an extra step to ensure your security and you will now be taken through a series of identity verification pages
