Subject: Your Card is Limited for Online Services
 Dear BOA Military Cardholder Continuous Monitoring is an integral part of Bank of America's multiple layers of security
 In addition to other fraud monitoring tools, we can often spot fraud based upon transactions on the card that are outside of cardholders typical purchasing pattern
 This allows us to spot fraudulent activity as quickly as possible and acts as an early-warning system to identify fraudulent activity
 During a recent checkout we detected suspicious activity and your Card may have been compromised
 Fraudulent activity made it necessary to limit your card for online services
 Conform to our security requirements and in order to continue online services with your card, we must validate your identity
