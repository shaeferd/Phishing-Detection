 Protecting the security of your account and of the Wells Fargo network is our primary concern
 Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily limited access to sensitive account features
 To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not been compromised: 1
 Login to your Wells Fargo Internet Banking account
 In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to fill in all the required information
 2
 Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or deposits, and check you account profile to make sure not changes have been made
 If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report this to Wells Fargo staff immediately
